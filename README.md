# Long War 2 for War of the Chosen (WOTC)

This is an attempt to port the Long War 2 (LW2) overhaul mod for XCOM 2 to the War
of the Chosen (WOTC) expansion. The scope is limited to getting the base LW2 experience
working, but not necessarily balanced. If WOTC features severely unbalance the game and
can be removed, they will be.

## Testing the mod

If you just want to playtest the mod and not work on the code see [Play testing Long War 2 [WOTC]](https://github.com/long-war-2/lwotc/wiki/Play-testing-Long-War-2-%5BWOTC%5D)
## Building and running the mod

Building and running this mod requires several steps:

 1. The media assets (video, graphics and sound) are kept as a [zip on Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5wtqt5xjg8mde02/lwotc-content.zip?dl=0).
    Download that file and unpack it into this project's _LongWarOfTheChosen/Content_ directory.

 2. Either clone [my fork of the X2WOTCCommunityHighlander repository](https://github.com/pledbrook/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander)
    or download the [`lwotc-dev` branch](https://github.com/pledbrook/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander/archive/lwotc-dev.zip)
	from GitHub.
	
 3. If you have cloned the repository, switch your clone to the `lwotc-dev` branch.
 
 4. Follow that [project's instructions](https://github.com/pledbrook/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander/blob/lwotc-dev/README.md)
    for building the highlander. In particular, make sure you copy the files in the highlander's _Src/XComGame/Classes_ to the WOTC SDK's _Development/SrcOrig_ directory, as described in the [_Building Against the Highlander_](https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander/#building-against-the-highlander) section.
    
    I recommend that after building it in ModBuddy, you cook a release of it. That's because the cooked version runs _much_ more quickly than the noseekfreeloading version. Alternatively, use the highlander's build script, which will build _and_ cook the highlander.

 5. Set up the following environment variables:
    * `XCOM2SDKPATH` — typically <path to Steam>\steamapps\common\XCOM 2 War Of The Chosen SDK
    * `XCOM2GAMEPATH` — typically <path to Steam>\steamapps\common\XCOM 2\XCom2-WarOfTheChosen
    Don't put these paths in quotes.
	
 6. Run the `build-lwotc.bat` file that you find in the root of the LWOTC project.
 
 7. When the build has finished, launch XCOM 2 WOTC and select both X2WOTCCommunityHighlander and
    LongWarOfTheChosen mods
