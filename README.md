# Long War of the Chosen (LWOTC)

This is a port of [Pavonis Interactive](https://www.pavonisinteractive.com/)'s
Long War 2 (LW2) overhaul mod for XCOM 2 to the War of the Chosen (WOTC)
expansion and update it for WOTC's new features.

## Installing and playing the mod

Long War of the Chosen is primarily distributed through Steam Workshop, in a few varieties:

### Stable release
[The stable release](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2683996590) stays unchanging for longer periods of time, mostly receiving bugfixes and localization updates. More experimental changes enter this item only after they've been adequately tested. This version is recommended if you're just starting or are otherwise unsure about which to choose. Mind that you can usually switch an ongoing campaign from stable to experimental, but not the other way around.

### Experimental release
[The experimental release](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663990965) receives more rapid and experimental updates, to be evaluated by the community. This version is recommended if you want to actively provide feedback or otherwise want the most cutting edge changes. However, note that this version can introduce more frequent and more serious bugs than the stable.

### Archive releases
The archive releases are only recommended if you have a campaign started on a specific version and are worried that upcoming changes cause instability or imbalance.
* [1.0.5.5 archive release](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114647033)
* [1.1.0 archive release](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3337324898)

## Contributing translations

If you would like to contribute to translations for LWOTC, then check out the
[wiki page](https://github.com/long-war-2/lwotc/wiki/Contributing#localization-translating-text-in-the-game)
that explains how it works.

## Building and running the mod

You will only need to read this section if you'd like to contribute code or assets to the project. It is also useful for localization work, but not required.

Note that you need to own the Shen's Last Gift DLC to build (and play) this version of the mod.

1. Make sure you have the WOTC SDK `full_content` branch installed - see the [r/xcom2mods wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcom2mods/wiki/index#wiki_setting_up_tools_for_modding) for details on how to do that (plus lots of other useful information).

1. Set up the following environment variables:
    * `XCOM2SDKPATH` — typically &lt;path to Steam&gt;\steamapps\common\XCOM 2 War Of The Chosen SDK
    * `XCOM2GAMEPATH` — typically &lt;path to Steam&gt;\steamapps\common\XCOM 2\XCom2-WarOfTheChosen

    Don't put these paths in quotes.

1. [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and then clone your fork locally, which you can do via [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) (a command-line tool), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), or some other Git client tool.

1. Download the LWOTC media assets (video, graphics and sound) from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P2njxwOIVeNDlox_21S5aQ2H_HqkMcvF/view?usp=sharing) and unpack the resulting zip file into this project's `LongWarOfTheChosen` directory.
It should merge the contents of the `Content` and `ContentForCook` directories.
If it replaces any version controlled files, `git checkout` them to restore their latest version.

1. Initialize submodules:
    ```sh
    git submodule update --init
    ```

1. Run the following from the LWOTC project directory:
    ```sh
    build-lwotc.bat -config default
    ```

    (You can specify `-config debug` to compile with debug info)

Once LWOTC is built, you will be able to select it as a local mod in Alternative Mod Launcher and run Long War of the Chosen.
