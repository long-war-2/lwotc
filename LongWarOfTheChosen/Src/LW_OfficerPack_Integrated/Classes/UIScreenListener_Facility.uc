//	AUTHOR:  Keith (KDM)
//	PURPOSE: Controller navigation, for UIFacilities, acts quite strangely at times. Here are just a few examples :
//	1.] If the rightmost staff slot is selected, and you hit D-Pad right, suddenly the room button, if one exists, becomes selected.
//	It would be better if selection looped within the staff slot container.
//	2.] If you press the left or right bumper, the Avenger shortcuts, at the bottom of the screen, become selected. At this point, D-Pad
//	down selects the room button, and D-Pad up does nothing.
//	3.] If you press right bumper --> D-Pad right --> D-Pad right, navigation becomes temporarily stuck on the 1st staff slot.
//	4.] If you press right bumper --> D-Pad right --> D-Pad left, there are suddenly 2 highlighted staff slots.
//	5.] Etc. Etc.
//
//	The solution : Kill the finicky navigation system and create it anew; this way we have complete control over its setup.

// KDM : A facility, represented by UIFacility, can contain up to 1 staff slot container, and up to 1 room container.
// 1.] The staff slot container, located on the top of the screen, stores all of the staff slots; typically a facility has between 1 and 4 staff slots.
// 2.] The room container, near the bottom of the screen, stores the room buttons; typically a facility has either 0 or 1 room buttons.
//
// For example, the base XCom 2 Guerilla Tactics School has 1 staff slot container which contains 1 staff slot; this staff slot is used to
// 'Train Rookies'. Furthermore, the facility has 1 room container containing 1 room button labelled 'New Combat Tactics'.
