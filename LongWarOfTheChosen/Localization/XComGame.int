LongDescription="By studying the methods used by the aliens to manage energy consumption and heat dissipation in their weapons, we've built a working prototype of what we're calling a pulsed laser weapon, although some of the troops prefer to call them 'blasters' for reasons that are obscure to me. The power we are able to put through these weapons is immense, but the system cannot maintain a continuous beam of such immense energies, so it insted relies on a series of picosecond-long pulses of intense energy density to break down any chemical bonds the beam encounters. These weapons should be more accurate and do more damage, on average, than the ballistic weapons we have been using, although they don't quite match the firepower of the weaponry we have seen the aliens operating.

LongDescription="The principles of coil-type magnetic weapons have long been known, but it has taken our understanding of alien materials and energy supplies to make that a reality. And the reality is we have developed weaponry that exceed the firepower of ADVENT troops and approach that of some alien weaponry. Our coilguns fire rounds sheathed in ablative plastic that melts away as the round travels through the gun barrel at speeds even greater than those achieved by the aliens' railgun-based systems. The round itself can punch through thin armor, as well. R. Tygan."

[AdvancedCoilguns X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Advanced Coilguns"
CodeName="Firefox"
Summary="We can now turn our attention to developing specialized coil weaponry."
LongDescription="The challenges in adapting our new coilgun designs to fit our defined combat roles were not insigificant; the coils themselves must be precisely machined so the round doesn't lose its way in the barrel, which could have catastrophic consequences for the gun and the user. This may explain why ADVENT never adopted this style of weaponry; they are too expensive and labor-intensive to produce, not really suited for industrial-scale production for a worldwide army of poorly trained clones. They are, however, an excellent fit for a small cadre of expert soldiers. R. Tygan."

CodeName="Friedrich"
LongDescription="The fact that we now have access to advanced magnetic weaponry that is both combat effective and safe to operate at these power levels is quite an achievement. The overall design relies on advanced miniaturization technologies developed by the aliens which are, frankly, well beyond anything conceived of by Earth's leading military development firms at the time of the invasion. Despite our limited capability for extended test firings on board the ship, our latest prototypes are already capable of consistently accelerating an adaptive alloy projectile to over 5000 m/s in a simulated environment. We're still preparing the final assessment, but it is likely a field deployable unit would have to be limited to a lower power threshold due to the potential for ongoing strain to our troops when operating the weapons.

CodeName="Marconi"
LongDescription="The Avenger serves our purposes adequately in terms of coordinating our communications network, but if we hope to increase our range and reach every possible outlet we will have to do more. A series of carefully positioned relay towers would suffice, assuming we can miniaturize the technology we've adapted from the aliens' own communications equipment. It may be difficult to balance the requisite power levels versus the increased chances of detection, but this is our best chance to expand on our capabilities. With the increased coverage, we can expect the efficiency of local resistance operations to improve, strengthening the groups working within range of the towers. R. Tygan."

CodeName="Yorrick"

The material itself seems to be the same as what the aliens utilized throughout the Avenger's hull, an extremely durable substance with an unusual ambient magnetic property. As an armor component, the magnetic fields surrounding these plates will actually provide additional protection against magnetic-based weaponry, most notably the gauss weaponry commonly equipped by ADVENT.

[EXOSuit X2TechTemplate]

Summary="If we combine the power-assisted armor prototypes we've been working on with some of the ADVENT plating we've recovered, we could develop a variant of our plated armor that allows us to add a heavy weapon mount directly to the armor, combining significant defensive and offensive capabilities in a single suit."
CodeName="Stark"
LongDescription="For the aliens, fielding heavier weapons, or more of them, usually means using a larger, heavier alien species to haul the gear into battle. For our needs, we have to rely on something more practical. I've been working on a variety of power-assisted armor prototypes, which, at the very least, should provide a means for our troops to bring another weapon into the fight. By combining these prototypes with the alien alloy plating we've experimented with previously, the armor should be almost as durable as our Predator prototypes. L. Shen."

[SpiderSuit X2TechTemplate]

Summary="Spotty records from the ruined mainframe at XCOM HQ indicate an early prototype for a light armor suit coupled with a grappling hook never came to fruition. Our recent mastery of the aliens' materials may allow us to revive the concept." 
CodeName="Fisher"
LongDescription="With the variety of environments our forces are currently engaging the enemy in, we need to give them every opportunity to gain a tactical advantage in the field. With that in mind, our latest armor prototype incorporates a basic powered-ascent mechanism capable of propelling the wearer to heights of over 10m with high levels of stability. The suit utilizes a number of micro-servo motors operating in sequence to aid in distributing the load throughout the armor, with the added side-effect of enhanced reflexes provided to the wearer. Although Central has made vague references to the previous science officer serving XCOM, he doesn't seem interested in discussing her efforts with me directly. I'm guessing the grapple design was something she created in collaboration with dad before XCOM fell. L. Shen."

[PoweredArmor X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Powered Armor"
Summary="Having found various means of integrating the alien materials within designs better suited to our own troops, I think it may be possible to assemble armor made entirely of the recovered alloys and powered by an Elerium cell. It should be incredibly strong, and able to withstand even direct hits from most alien weaponry."
CodeName="Goliath"
LongDescription="From what we've seen of the aliens' activities and their lack of regard for human life, preserving those of us that are still around has to become a task of equal importance to eliminating the alien threat itself. The success of this entire undertaking hinges on our ability to keep our soldiers healthy and ready for battle at a moment's notice. In working towards that aim, our latest armor prototype utilizes more of the alien alloys than any we've previously assembled, and as expected the durability and potential for damage mitigation is extremely impressive. Initial trials show the armor to be capable of withstanding a direct hit from focused plasma at 5m, enough so to increase survivability by a substantial margin. I plan on advising the senior staff not to inform the troops of any perceived toughness associated with the suit, I would hate for our forces to grow reliant on it despite our best intentions. L. Shen."

[WraithSuit X2TechTemplate]
DisplayName="Shadow Armor"
Summary="Having seen the aliens manipulating Psionic fields for a variety of purposes, we've theorized it may be possible to traverse through the physical confines of our world by developing a Psionic field enmeshed in a specially designed light armor suit."
CodeName="Loki"
LongDescription="Even though we're learning more about the alien's varying uses for the Psionic energy fields they manipulate, so far we haven't spent much time trying to harness these capabilities for our own purposes. Direct access to the biomechanical alien we've been calling the \"Codex\" has given us far better insight into the nature of Psionics than any of our previous experimentation. The Codex has the unique ability to phase through not just physical objects, but between worlds, and, in theory, dimensions. By focusing a carefully balanced pulse of Psionic energy, the Codex creates a rift, effectively peeling back the layers of spacetime. The possible implications of this ability are mind bobbling, but it's safe to say I won't be recommending we pursue this advance to the Commander. However, there are other areas of interest tied Codex. During our testing, we conceived of the possibility that the Psionic pulse could be diverted, or scattered, across an electromagnetic field integrated into a suit of armor. This would effectively create a weakened rift throughout the suit, allowing the wearer to phase through objects within our own dimension. The prototype is stable, but field trials are ongoing. L. Shen."

Summary="By harnessing the power of Elerium, it may be possible to create a new powered-armor suit capable of generating a defensive force field not unlike those used on the alien craft."
CodeName="Titan"
LongDescription="With our supply of Elerium crystals limited by what our soldiers can recover in the field, I've been hesitant to recommend we commit them to any one project exclusively. However, in the wake of recent events, it seems like we need to work on developing an armor suit with significant durability and the ability to mount a heavy weapon. In order to do that, we've integrated an Elerium-based power cell into one our stronger frames. With the Elerium's incredible energy throughput, the suit can now support the use a self-contained force field. In the simplest of terms, we've mirrored the technologies most commonly used by the aliens in the defense of their UFOs, and fused them with a platform our troops can deploy in the field. I expect great things from this unit. L. Shen."

[Header_RESISTANCE X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="LONG WAR 2 CONCEPTS: RESISTANCE HAVENS"

[OutpostManagement_General X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Haven Management"
DescriptionTitle="Haven Management"
DescriptionEntry="In Long War 2, the Commander will take over management of the worldwide Resistance movement against the ADVENT administration. In regions XCOM has made contact with, you will use the Haven Management screen to direct the priorities of Resistance cells. Individual Resistance members will be listed on this screen. Resistance members can be assigned to one of four tasks: SUPPLY, RECRUIT, INTEL or HIDING. Note that rebels assigned to new jobs will not begin work until the following day. "

[OutpostManagement_Supply X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="The Supply Job"
DescriptionTitle="The Supply Job"
DescriptionEntry="Resistance personnel on the SUPPLY job are focused on scavenging supplies from around their regions. More rebels assigned to the Supply job will mean a larger Supply drop each month. Note that over time in a given region, the Supply job will grow less effective as the Resistance scrounges the most easily recovered materiel."

[OutpostManagement_Recruit X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="The Recruit Job"
DescriptionTitle="The Recruit Job"
DescriptionEntry="Resistance members assigned to the RECRUIT job are busy in the communities looking for volunteers willing to join the Resistance. Recruits may either join the local Haven or, if they have potential as an XCOM trooper, they will enter the pool of potential recruits for soldier training. More rebels assigned to the Recruit job will mean faster recruiting of both Resistance members and soldiers. If recruiting in a liberated region, you have a small chance to find a scientist or engineer willing to work for XCOM."

[OutpostManagement_Intel X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="The Intel Job"
DescriptionTitle="The Intel Job"
DescriptionEntry="Resistance members put on the INTEL job will look for information on ADVENT and alien operations. They will generate a small income of the intel resource, but their main function is to detect alien activities and alert XCOM to vulnerabilities in the enemy security network, leading to mission alerts which XCOM can send troops on. More Resistance members on the intel job will detect more missions, and they will often detect them more quickly than they otherwise would. This gives your troops more time to infiltrate those targets, which is vital to generating survivable missions. IMPORTANT: The Avenger can assist greatly in the Intel job in a single region. Scanning at the Resistance Haven site will produce intel and missions equivalent to the contributions of several unpromoted Resistance members."

[OutpostManagement_Hiding X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="The Hiding Job"
DescriptionTitle="The Hiding Job"
DescriptionEntry="Resistance members who are put in the HIDING job will produce no resources, but they will also avoid any unwanted attention from ADVENT. Busy Havens are more likely to attract ADVENT retaliatory strikes, so putting rebels on the Hiding job will lower the Haven's profile. ADVENT will more rapidly lose interest in regions with numerous Resistance members in hiding, or with few Resistance members overall, and will be less likely to move troops in."

[OutpostManagement_Capacity X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Haven Operating Capacity"
DescriptionTitle="Haven Operating Capacity"
DescriptionEntry="Each Haven only has the capacity for maximum of 13 Resistance members at that Haven to be assigned to the SUPPLY, RECRUIT, or INTEL jobs; the rest will be treated as reserves and put in the HIDING job."

[OutpostManagement_Reprisals X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="ADVENT Reprisals"
DescriptionTitle="ADVENT Reprisals"
DescriptionEntry="In retaliations and similar missions, Resistance members will appear during tactical combat. Depending on the operation, they may sometimes be armed, although they will be less effective than XCOM soldiers in combat. XCOM soldiers are also sometimes required to activate a Resistance member by moving close to them, giving the player control of their actions, so they can move to escape areas as necessary. In addition, XCOM can recover certain ADVENT assets and repurpose them for Haven defense, granting additional units to assist in combat."

[OutpostManagement_Promotions X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Resistance Promotions"
DescriptionTitle="Resistance Promotions"
DescriptionEntry="Over time, Resistance members can become better at their jobs. Resistance members who have gained a level will be marked with an asterisk on the Haven Management Screen. Expert members who have gained a second level will be marked with an additional asterisk. These promoted rebels will produce more results on any job they are assigned to, and they will also receive XCOM perks for use in combat."

[OutpostManagement_Advisers X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="XCOM Advisers"
DescriptionTitle="XCOM Advisers"
DescriptionEntry="XCOM may assign a single adviser from its staff to each Haven to assist in various tasks. The adviser may be assigned by clicking the photo frame in the top-left of the Haven Management screen. Assigning an engineer will generate bonuses for the Supply job in the region. Assigning a scientist will generate bonuses to the Intel job. Assigning a soldier will generate bonuses to the Recruit job; the soldier will also appear on combat missions involving Haven personnel. The soldier will also hunt for any ADVENT infiltrators in the Haven. Higher-ranking soldiers will generate more bonuses. The soldier should be outfitted with gear on the Avenger BEFORE departing for the Haven. If a Resistance Haven is entirely wiped out by enemy action, the only way to recruit new rebels is to station a soldier in the region. Advisers may be unassigned from the Haven by clicking on their portrait, as long as ADVENT doesn't have any active reprisals against the Resistance underway in the region."

[Header_INFILTRATION X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="LONG WAR 2 CONCEPTS: INFILTRATION"

[Infiltration_Help1 X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Infiltration Summary"
DescriptionTitle="Infiltration Summary"
DescriptionEntry="Many of XCOM's offensive operations require infiltration of the target site over a period of several days. Infiltrating a mission site represents XCOM forces concealing themselves from ADVENT patrols and gathering intelligence on enemy activities. This careful preparation allows XCOM to strike when the time is right. During infiltrations, the XCOM forces will not be available for other missions, unless you abort the infiltration and return the troops to base, canceling any progress you have made. XCOM may have multiple infiltrations underway at once. Properly infiltrating these sites is crucial to conducting missions that XCOM can win."

[Infiltration_Help2 X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Infiltration Missions"
DescriptionTitle="Infiltration Missions"
DescriptionEntry="These missions use an INFILTRATION START button at the top center of the Squad Select screen. After selecting your squad and beginning an infiltration, the mission pin on the Geoscape will show a percent-infiltrated value ranging from 0 to 200%. The more the squad infiltrates a site, the fewer enemy units it will face on the mission. This is the critical role infiltration plays in Long War 2."

[Infiltration_Help3 X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Infiltration Progress"
DescriptionTitle="Infiltration Progress"
DescriptionEntry="While it is possible to launch an attack on many of these sites immediately, the squad could face two to three times as many enemies without properly preparing for the mission. The amount of extra forces is indicated by the Enemy Readiness description in the Infiltration Options panel, which can be Impregnable, Fortified, Alerted, Guarded, Normal and Vulnerable. There are invisible gradations within these categories, so every additional hour spent infiltrating makes it more likely XCOM will face a lesser enemy force. More time spent infiltrating also reduces the time the Skyranger takes to arrive when the squad throws an evac flare. Note that some critical missions require at least 100% infiltration before the mission may be launched."

[Infiltration_Help4 X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Enemy Activity"
DescriptionTitle="Enemy Activity"
DescriptionEntry="The impact on enemy forces is also noted in the Current and Baseline enemy activity readouts in Squad Select and the infiltration panels. These descriptions, such as \"light,\" \"heavy,\" or \"swarming\" indicate how many enemies you are likely to face, not counting any reinforcements the aliens are able to summon. The baseline enemy activity description, reported when the mission is first detected and in the Squad Selection screen, represents the expected enemy force level if you infiltrate to 100%. The current enemy activity level is what it would be if you launched the mission at that moment. You can gain further bonuses by infiltrating to 200%, although no mission will drop below \"Extremely Light\" activity, and the benefits accumulate much more slowly after exceeding 100%."

[Infiltration_Help5 X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Boosting Infiltrations"
DescriptionTitle="Boosting Infiltrations"
DescriptionEntry="Once per infiltration, the Commander may also assist an infiltration by electing to spend some of XCOM's Intel resource. Using the \"Boost Infiltration\" button in the Infiltration Options panel will give you the option of spending 25 intel to significantly increase the rate of infiltration. You can use this option at any time during the infiltration, as its benefits apply retroactively."

[Infiltration_Help6 X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Managing Infiltration Time"
DescriptionTitle="Managing Infiltration Time"
DescriptionEntry="The Commander has some control over the amount of time it takes to infiltrate a mission site by using smaller or larger squads and by selecting certain soldier perks and gear. This is represented by information presented in the Squad Select screen. The \"Base Infiltration\" value is how many days a typical XCOM squad of five soldiers will take to infiltrate the site to 100%. The Squad Size modifier value is the impact of the currently selected squad size. The stealth modifier is the impact of abilities and gear. Certain perks, particularly Infiltrator and Tradecraft, lower infiltration time. Units carrying submachine guns and certain other specialized stealth gear can further lower it. Meanwhile, heavy weapons soldiers will increase the squad's infiltration time."

[Infiltration_Help7 X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Mission Expiration"
DescriptionTitle="Mission Expiration"
DescriptionEntry="Many missions also expire; the time left until expiration is noted in the Mission Expiration value in the Squad Select screen. The earlier the local Resistance Haven's intel section detects an enemy operation, the more time XCOM will have until the mission expires. This will often prevent squads from reaching 100% infiltration. When a mission is expiring on the Geoscape, an alert will give the Commander the choice of going in at the current infiltration level or aborting."

[ResistanceManagement X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Resistance Management"
DescriptionTitle="Resistance Management"
DescriptionEntry="The Resistance management panel allows XCOM to direct the activities of Resistance cells around the world. New Resistance Havens will appear here as contact is established, along with a summary of their current strength and activities. Selecting a region will take you the appropriate Haven management panel (see below)."

[SquadManagement X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Squad Management"
DescriptionTitle="Squad Management"
DescriptionEntry="The squad manager lets you organize squads of troops who can be assigned as a group to a particular mission. Squads operate under the following guidelines:<br/><Bullet/> Up to 12 soldiers may be assigned to a squad, and squads may be chosen in the squad select interface immediately before a mission.<br/><Bullet/> If a squad member is wounded, in training or just not a good fit for a mission, you can substitute in a temporary squad member from the pool of unassigned soldiers on a mission-by-mission basis.<br/><Bullet/> You may also build a squad entirely from unassigned members just before a mission; they will be given a name (for reference on the Geoscape), and that squad will be disbanded as soon as the mission is over.<br/><Bullet/> To transfer soldiers from one permanent squad to another, they must first be unassigned from their current squad."

[ExperiencePoints X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Soldier Experience"
DescriptionTitle="Soldier Experience"
DescriptionEntry="Soldiers gain experience and levels primarily by going on missions, with a smaller portion coming directly from the soldier individually killing enemies. Mission XP is based on how many enemies are present on the map at the beginning of a tactical mission, and it is divided equally among the troops after the mission if it is successful, regardless of how many enemies were killed. Note this means that sending fewer soldiers on a mission will result in them receiving a greater share of the mission XP. If XCOM fails to achieve its objectives during the mission, a smaller amount of shared mission XP is rewarded based on how many enemies were killed, with the maximum capped at 50% of what a successful mission would have provided."

[Liberation X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Liberating Regions"
DescriptionTitle="Liberating Regions"
DescriptionEntry="The Resistance, with sufficient help from XCOM, may now liberate regions entirely from ADVENT control. They must detect and undertake a series of increasingly difficult missions to do this, culminating with strikes on ADVENT's power centers in the region. The aliens will undertake almost no activities in liberated regions unless they attempt to retake it. The Resistance will generate bonus supplies, recruits and intel for XCOM in liberated regions. Any active infiltrations in a region that is liberated will receive a significant bonus to infiltration percentage, and then the Commander will have to decide whether to go on that mission immediately or abort before ADVENT retreats its forces to neighboring regions. Liberating a region should give the Resistance sufficient access to ADVENT infrastructure that we may begin to discover the aliens' true purpose on Earth before it is too late."

[AlienForces X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Alien and ADVENT Forces"
DescriptionTitle="Alien and ADVENT Forces"
DescriptionEntry="As powerful as they are, the aliens do have limits on their capabilities. They have spread their forces around the globe in an attempt to engage the Resistance, and some places they are stronger than others. Our intelligence teams provide estimates of enemy strengths in each contacted region; that strength will change over time as ADVENT moves troops to areas of high XCOM and Resistance activity, leaving other areas potentially vulnerable. Missions in regions which have heavy ADVENT presence will be far more difficult in areas they are not giving much attention to."

[Corpses X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Enemy Corpses"
DescriptionTitle="Enemy Corpses"
DescriptionEntry="Because of many of our missions require rapid exfiltration from a battle site, we are often unable to collect the remains of our ADVENT and alien enemies for research or rendering into useful alien materials. Offensive missions that offer the possibility to gather enemy corpses should be made a priority."

[AlienTactics X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Enemy Tactics"
DescriptionTitle="Enemy Tactics"
DescriptionEntry="Unless they are assigned to attack or protect a particular target, ADVENT and their alien allies will patrol a combat zone. If they patrol into XCOM on the alien turn, they have a chance to take certain defensive actions after they scatter. During their patrols, if they hear weapons fire or explosions, see a corpse, or hear yelling civilians, they may go into a higher state of alert. If they are in a heightened state of alert and they encounter XCOM on their turn, they may take certain offensive actions, including shooting, after their scatter move as long as they are unwounded. Note that heavy weapons and explosives may alert enemies at greater distances than other weapons, while melee weapons are only audible at very short ranges."

[TrainingOfficers X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Officer Training"
DescriptionTitle="Officer Training"
DescriptionEntry="The Guerrilla Tactics school contains up to two slots for you to pick soldiers from the armory and train them as officers. Officers may gain a number of special abilities to assist on missions, but only one officer may go on a mission at a time. You may begin selecting officers from your soldiers who have reached corporal rank. Officers have a Command Range that increases with their officer rank; it determines the distance at which many of their abilities are effective."

[Sharpshooter_LWS X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
ListTitle="Sharpshooter Class"
DescriptionTitle="Sharpshooter Class"
DescriptionEntry="Relying primarily on high-powered rifles to eliminate hostile targets from long distances, Sharpshooters may specialize as a sniper capable of long-range ambushes, or as a mobile marksman who can target enemies from just behind our front lines. Sharpshooters are also equipped with the Holo-Targeter, a device used to designate targets for the rest of XCOM."

[RadioRelays X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
DescriptionEntry="Constructing Radio Relays will extend the range from which we can contact new, previously unexplored regions. Building relays at the edges of our current reach will provide the greatest benefit in terms of added range. Radio Relays make rebels more effective at their jobs, and the Intel cost of contacting neighboring regions will be reduced.

[Avenger X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
DescriptionEntry="Serving as XCOM's mobile headquarters, the Avenger was once a basic transport vessel utilized by the aliens during the invasion. Shot down and disabled by forces unknown, the ship was apparently abandoned by the aliens, only to be discovered by Dr. Raymond Shen who first proposed an attempt at reclaiming the vessel for XCOM. Although many facets of the alien technology remain a mystery, the ship itself is now reliably under XCOM's control and has proven to be crucial to the resurgent Resistance movement.<br/><br/>One of the most important roles of the Avenger is to assist in scanning for missions in a given region. Scanning at a Haven provides a significant bonus to Intel gathered there."

[Concealment X2EncyclopediaTemplate]
DescriptionEntry="With limited tactical resources, XCOM has to rely on stealth to gain the upper hand on our enemies. Many operations begin with the XCOM squad in concealment. By avoiding the enemy's detection radius, XCOM can remain concealed until they reach the mission objective. Various factors can impact enemy detection radii, including what gear XCOM is carrying and abilities they have trained."

[EVAC X2EncyclopediaTemplate]

DescriptionTitle="EVAC"
DescriptionEntry="XCOM can request an emergency evacuation from the battlefield at the Commander's discretion. Once the Skyranger has been contacted, the soldier making the call will need to select a rendezvous point for the evacuation to occur. Doing so will reveal the squad if it is concealed. Once placed, the squad will need to move into the designated EVAC volume and request a rope out. Note that the Skyranger may take some time to arrive: if XCOM has many infiltrations active around the globe, has poorly infiltrated this particular mission, or has a large squad, expect to have to defend the evac zone until the Skyranger can arrive."

Soldiers elgible for extra training can select abilities in one of three categories: offensive, defensive and pistol. For offensive and defensive abilities, soldiers may train up to three abilities in each category. The abilities are randomly generated for each soldier, but the abilities unlocked after finishing a training segment will generally be stronger than the previous ones. For pistol abilities, soldiers may train all seven, given enough time."

It is widely believed that the ADVENT Peacekeeping forces in a given region are coordinated from somewhere within the regional tower. We also believe that a master tower somewhere serves as the hub for distributing information and commands to all of the regional towers.
