LongDescription="On both the physical and genetic level, the ADVENT Stun Lancers are nearly identical to the Troopers our forces regularly see in combat. However, a minor yet crucial adjustment to the muscle fiber density of the Lancer improves both agility and overall survivability. Equipped with non-lethal weapons capable of easily disabling human targets, these Lancers were first deployed during the earliest days following ADVENT's establishment of the city centers, when civil unrest was a more common problem than outright resistance. In studying their usage and deployment, this raised an interesting question - if the Lancers were among the first ADVENT forces deployed, and their survivability is somewhat higher than that of the standard Trooper - did the aliens consciously reduce the Trooper's strength based on their assessment of human combat readiness? This would imply a system of rapid genetic modification beyond what I had previously imagined the aliens were capable of. It would also demonstrate a degree of \"genetic frugality\" that I would have previously assumed was irrelevant to the aliens, based on the variety of unusual experiments they've conducted. R.
